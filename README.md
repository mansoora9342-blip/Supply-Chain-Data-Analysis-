# Supply Chain Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain operations using SQL and Power BI to evaluate supplier performance, delivery efficiency, and inventory health.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI

## Data & Workflow
- Designed a structured supply chain database containing supplier, product, order, delivery, lead time, and stock data.
- Performed SQL-based analysis to calculate KPIs such as On-Time Delivery Rate, Average Lead Time, Delay Days, Inventory Turnover, and Supplier Efficiency Score.
- Cleaned, aggregated, and transformed data for reporting.

## Power BI Dashboard
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize supplier-wise performance, delivery status trends, lead time distribution, and stock level risks.
- Used filters and slicers for dynamic analysis across suppliers, products, and categories.

## Key Insights
- Identified delivery bottlenecks and high-delay suppliers.
- Highlighted low-stock products with potential stockout risks.
- Provided data-driven recommendations to improve delivery efficiency and inventory management.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical skills in SQL analytics, KPI development, and Power BI dashboarding for supply chain optimization.
